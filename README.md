# todo.py
A simple todolist written in Python 2.7.

Running todo.py allows you to add items to a list using "add," or remove items using "pop" or "remove" etc.

Print shows you your list, write writes it to a designated file for you, and read pulls it from a pre-existing file.

It's probably more complex than it needs to be.
